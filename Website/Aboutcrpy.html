              <h2>CRYPTO-CURRENCY</h2>
              <p>What is it?</p>
            </div>
            <p> A cryptocurrency, crypto-currency, or crypto is a collection of binary data which is designed to work as a medium of exchange.
                Individual coin ownership records are stored in a ledger, which is a computerized database using strong cryptography to secure 
                transaction records, to control the creation of additional coins, and to verify the transfer of coin ownership.
                Cryptocurrencies are generally fiat currencies, as they are not backed by or convertible into a commodity.
                Some crypto schemes use validators to maintain the cryptocurrency. In a proof-of-stake model, owners put up their tokens as 
                collateral. In return, they get authority over the token in proportion to the amount they stake. Generally, these token stakers 
                get additional ownership in the token over time via network fees, newly minted tokens or other such reward mechanisms.
            </p>
            <p>
                Cryptocurrency does not exist in physical form (like paper money) and is typically not issued by a central authority. 
                Cryptocurrencies typically use decentralized control as opposed to a central bank digital currency (CBDC).When a cryptocurrency 
                is minted or created prior to issuance or issued by a single issuer, it is generally considered centralized. When implemented with 
                decentralized control, each cryptocurrency works through distributed ledger technology, typically a blockchain, that serves as a public 
                financial transaction database.
